\brief a Message buffer to manage Messages storage

	The RingBuffer object automatically wrap the read and write indexes.
	It's the client responsability to check for overrun and underrun. 
	The \c available() method is provided both for getting the count of available data 
	and for overrun and underrun checking, indicated by an available data count
	greater than the buffer size or less than 0.
	
	Available data are fetched using the [] operator which expects indexes in the range
	\c [0,n[ where \c n is the count of available data. In case \c n is outside this range, 
	the ring buffer reads the available data in loop.
	
	When done with the new data, the \c done() method should be called to reset the
	count of available data to 0.
